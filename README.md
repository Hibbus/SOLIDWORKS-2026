# Four-Bar Link Mechanism

The first mechanism I modeled in SOLIDWORKS was this Four-Bar Link Mechanism. I have included a picture below.

The objective of the assignment was to model its motion using SOLIDWORKS Motion.

# Double-Crank Four-Bar Link Mechanism

The Double-Crank Four-Bar Link Mechanism is similar to the previous only the parts are scaled such that both side links are able to do a full crank/rotation.

The rotation is modeled below:

The Piston-Crank assignment was different in that it involved modeling different forces. The assignment involved modeling the mechanism including gravity, friction, a combustion force, a flywheel torque and an output torque. By turning off forces one-by-one it was possible to identify the ways they impact the mechanism's motion.

The following motion simulation considers gravity, friction, combustion force and flywheel torque. That is, the engine runs without a load.

# Shaft Support Base

This was part of a part design question. This part needed to be designed using complex rib techniques. The SOLIDWORKS "rib" tool gave an undesired result therefore I had to first create a secondary sketch to which to apply the rib in order to have the part look as desired.

A critical part of Engineering Design is being able to turn CAD files into flat drawings. I did that as part of this assignment. I include the design drawing below:

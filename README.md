# Four-Bar Link Mechanism

The first mechanism I modeled in SOLIDWORKS was this Four-Bar Link Mechanism. I have included a picture below.

The objective of the assignment was to model its motion using SOLIDWORKS Motion.


# Double-Crank Four-Bar Link Mechanism

The Double-Crank Four-Bar Link Mechanism is similar to the previous only the parts are scaled such that both side links are able to do a full crank/rotation.

# Piston-Crank Mechanism

The Piston-Crank assignment was different in that it involved modeling different forces. The assignment involved modeling the mechanism including gravity, friction, a combustion force, a flywheel torque and an output torque. By turning off forces one-by-one it was possible to identify the ways they impact the mechanism's motion.

# Shaft Support Base

This was part of a part design question. This part needed to be designed using complex rib techniques. The SOLIDWORKS "rib" tool gave an undesired result therefore I had to first create a secondary sketch to which to apply the rib in order to have the part look as desired.
